/**
 * 
 * 
 * This Folder is about learing modules in node js 
 * In node js, we can easily create functions and resources that can be reused 
 * for different purposes 
 * Like a module to add two numbers 
 * a module to know if a person is old enough to drive etc 
 * 
 * To show how modules work, I will be creating a simple module to check if 
 * a person is eligible to drive 
 * 
 * This module is contained in checkDriver.js 
 * and is used in app.js
